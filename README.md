With browsers creating empty profiles for different accounts or usage, it can be a pain to keep the commonly used extensions installed. This page has links to the extensions I use, separated by browser.

The page was built using the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and [Creative-Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/)'s [Papper Kit 2](https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-kit-2/index.html). The hero image and the logo icon where created using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/).
